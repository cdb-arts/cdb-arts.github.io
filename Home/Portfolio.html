	   <h2><center> <strong> About Chiara! </strong></center></h2> 
	   <img src="chi.jpg" height="35%" width="35%" align="left"> <p> My name is Chiara BoisAubin. I currently live in Boston, MA but I am originally from New York. I attended Wheaton College for Asian Studies and Studio Art and received my Digital Design Certification from Art Institute of Pittsburgh. Designing and coding is something that I enjoy doing. My designing interest started when I was in high school; I would use my artistic skills to create posters for non-profits that I was involved with and for school events.<br>

 <br> Digital design allows me to use my passion for technology and the fine arts; it is a challenge that allows me to learn and create something from scratch, or improve an existing design.

 Coding and Designing make me smile and feel as though I am accomplishing something, turning fantasy into reality. When I was learning how to code it was an amazing experience to see what I wrote come to life. Designing and coding are the adventures that I want to continue. </p>
