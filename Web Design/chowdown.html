    <h1>Reasearch</h1>
<p> The client enjoys eating out and while having a meeting at the same time. With their daily eating out notice three things while dining out: Being served was taking too long, spittling the bill was a challenge in a group, and they kept repeating what they cannot eat.   The clients prime objective was having the application for reservations and able to pre-order food.
 In our research, we've found that people will wait 25-30 minutes to be served. There are restaurants like in Japan that has different ways to get served and order food. Some restaurants in the U.S are finding methods to serve better. For example, with there was a Korean BBQ spot in California that has a buzzer at the table that notifies the server when someone needs assistance.

<br>
There are a couple of food chains like McDonald's  that are able to do pre-order.
 We created a survey that <b> 20 </b> people completed and here is what we found: </p>
<ul class="co">
<li> 25% had a dietary needs and not willing to go to a restaurant because of their restriction with food </li>
<li> 35% felt that splitting a bill within a group was a hassle </li>
<li> 10% of people had bad food service experience due to a long service</li>
</ul>

    <h1> Wireframe for the user </h1>
    <p>
      We needed to make sure that the application pages were not cluttered and navigation was not complex. We wanted to make sure that it was not difficult to understand for the age 25-50. We wanted to make sure that the user's account was always accessible.
     The live ordering should only be accessible only to the restaurant so adding will not have an issue while the reservation is happening. There are about 90 wireframe screens.</p>

<div class="projects">
	<h1> Prototype </h1>
  <p>This is an application that I have been assisting. I had to organize and construct the mockups and wireframe, and build about 55 pages.  This is the mockup that I had to use to make the pages and will launch in July. The clients wanted the web application to have a similar style like GrubHub and Dominos website and mobile application. We found other companies with betas that allow you to pre-order, but there were a couple of gaps with the host table and the chefs.
