      <p>  The two founders enjoy eating out and having their meetings at the same time. Their daily dining out notices three things: Time a took long to get served, splitting the bill was difficult in a group, and they kept repeating what they cannot eat to servers.  The clients prime objective was having the application for reservations and able to pre-order food.
       In our research, we've found that people will wait on average 25-30 minutes to be served. This time could be time to serve another group. 42% people miscalculate tips, and 34% overpaid in a group payment.
       <br> There are restaurants in Japan and Korea that found different ways to serve and order food. One idea that restaurants have done was placing a  call button place on the table, pre-order at the entrance of the restaurant (Buzzfeed's 'Worth it' season, they went to a Korean BBQ restaurant in California that had a buzzer on the table that notifies the server when someone needs assistance). There are some restaurants in the U.S that are using similar methods to serve people better and faster. McDonald's has a touch screen for people to order what they like and someone serves them.
We have found that there are a lot of methods that can improve and modernize the restaurant industry. Having a mobile app would help people who want to enjoy their food, but helps keep information for restaurants and server.</p>

              <p> We needed to make sure that the application pages were not cluttered and navigation was not complex. We wanted to make sure that it was not difficult to understand for the age 25-50. We wanted to make sure that the user's account was always accessible.
           The live ordering should only be accessible only to the restaurant so adding will not have an issue while the reservation is happening. There are about 90 wireframe screens.</p>

            <p>This is an application that I have been assisting. I had to organize and construct the mockups and wireframe, and build about 55 pages.  This is the mockup that I had to use to make the pages and will launch in July. The clients wanted the web application to have a similar style like GrubHub and Dominos website and mobile application. We found other companies with betas that allow you to pre-order, but there were a couple of gaps with the host table and the chefs.</p>
